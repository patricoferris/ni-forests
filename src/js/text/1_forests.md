## Forests and Woodland Cover by County

Northern Ireland is made up of six counties. The map now shows 
the woodland and forest cover per county.

The colours indicate the percentage of woodland cover when compared to 
total land per county. Totals are also given. The unit of measurement 
here is the [hectare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare), for those 
unfamiliar it is a unit of measurement for area and is equivalent to 
10,000 square metres (`100m x 100m`).

Taken at face value, Fermanagh is quite clearly ahead of the other counties 
in terms of percentage woodland cover (~15.9%) and Armagh the worst (~5.5%).

Taking these numbers and averaging them out yields **8.9%** forest cover. The EU 
[quotes around *37.7%*](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/105/the-european-union-and-forests#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20forests%20cover%2037.7,10)
of its land area being forest. Not necessarily a fair comparison given factors like 
population density, feasible economic activity (e.g. farming) and habitability. But even
compared to a [close neighbour like France (~31%)](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/07/20/why-frances-forests-are-getting-bigger)
it is really not great.

Another often overlooked dimension to "forest cover" is the type of forest. [Ancient woodland](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/habitats/ancient-woodland/)
(areas wooded since before 1600) is one of the most valuable habitats in the UK. The [Woodland Trust](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/)
[conducted a survey](https://ati.woodlandtrust.org.uk/back-on-the-map) aiming to identifiy *long-established* (~1830) woods in Northern Ireland. They found: 

> Woods that could be classified with any degree of certainty as ancient were many times scarcer in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK, covering only 0.04 per cent of Northern Ireland's land area.

A truly sad statistic.
