## Northern Ireland

This is Northern Ireland. One of the four *countries* that make 
up the United Kingdom. Here are some things you might not have 
known: 

 - As of the [2011 census](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2011-census-key-statistics-northern-ireland)
   it has a population of 1,811,000 people.
 - Lough Neagh is the [largest lake](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lough-Neagh) in the [British Isles](https://www.britannica.com/place/British-Isles). I'll 
   let you work out where that is on the map.
 - It has the [most bombed hotel in Europe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12322222).

Anyway, this [wee](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/319464/how-is-wee-used-in-northern-ireland) interactive app 
was made during [COP26](https://ukcop26.org/) whilst I was living in Cambridge feeling utterly useless. The idea was to discover more 
about the forests in Northern Ireland.

*For the programmers out there, it is all made using [OCaml](https://v3.ocaml.org)*.
