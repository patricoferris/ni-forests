## New Trees in the Belfast Hills

After protecting existing trees and [rewilding](https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/explore-rewilding/what-is-rewilding)
as much as possible through [natural regeneration](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/natural-regeneration/), there's 
still a need to plant trees.

Not only that, but we need:

 - To plant the right kind of trees. More specifically, native trees. Even better are locally-sourced,
   native trees which provide some of the same benefits of natural regeneration in that we minimise
   potential for bio-security risk (from pests and invasive species) and aim to keep genetic diversity and 
   adaption to specific local environments.
 - Engage local communities. To reach the scale necessary for success, engagement in local communities is 
   paramount. [Sacco and Hardwick et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15498) state it 
   very well: 

   > For large-scale reforestation projects, engagement of multiple stakeholders is required, to meet 
   > the diverse goals of enhancing rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, 
   > watershed protection and the provision of other ecosystem services

   In fact their paper is well worth a read. Their comments on "Making it pay" are not very in-depth but overall I think it is a useful read.
 - An incentive to keep the newly planted trees alive whilst simultaneously ensuring 
   the system is trusted. We've already seen the exploitation of "tree planting" for
   economic profit or a [nice badge for large corporations to flash](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies) 
   around claiming they are "socially responsible". See [The Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits](https://anil.recoil.org/projects/4c)
   for some interesting work to establish trusted infrastructure for tackling this.

The map has zoomed to near Cavehill and Belfast Zoo where the Woodland Trust are planning on planting some 150,000 trees 
for a new [Glas-na-Bradan Wood](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/northern-ireland/glas-na-bradan-wood/).
As far as I can tell this is an example of afforestation (I couldn't find any information saying it previously was woodland) done correctly.

 - There is a real sense of importance of local engagement, both in the naming of the wood and in the 
   events for tree-planting. "Our vision is for every tree on the site to be planted by the local community".
   In fact I dispatched my parents to plant some of them.
 - The Woodland Trust's ongoing work to include important environmental policies in the agenda for the
   Northern Irish government including: planting more native tress, restoring all ancient and long-established woodland,
   promoting *locally-sourced* trees over imported ones and improving access to green spaces. For more details [visit their site](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/northern-ireland/ni-manifesto/).

Access to green space is incredibly important. The [NHS Forest](https://nhsforest.org/) project is evidence of this:

> The NHS Forest works with healthcare professionals and organisations to make green spaces available for health purposes. We carry out practical work on the empirical links between health and the environment.
