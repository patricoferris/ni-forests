## Case Study: New Trees in the Belfast Hills

Simply protecting existing woodland and forests is not enough. Even if we did that.

Indeed, we need to plant trees. Not only that, but we need:

 - To plant the right kind of trees. More specifically, native trees. Biodiversity 
   is probably the single most important metric in ensuring [devastating monoculture forests]()
   don't keep springing up.
 - Engage local communities. To reach the scale necessary for success engagement in local communities is 
   paramount. [Sacco and Hardwick et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15498) state it 
   very well: 

   > For large-scale reforestation projects, engagement of multiple stakeholders is required, to meet 
   > the diverse goals of enhancing rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, 
   > watershed protection and the provision of other ecosystem services

   In fact their paper is well worth a read.
 - An incentive to keep the newly planted trees alive whilst simultaneously ensuring 
   the system is trusted. We've already seen the exploitation of "tree planting" for
   [economic profit](https://blog.ecosia.org/how-do-ecosia-trees-survive-cut-down/) 
   or a [nice badge for large corporations to flash](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies) 
   around claiming they are "socially responsible". See [The Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits](https://anil.recoil.org/projects/4c)
   for some interesting work to establish trusted infrastructure for tackling this.

The map has zoomed in to near Cavehill and Belfast Zoo where the Woodland Trust are planning on planting some 150,000 trees 
for a new [Glas-na-Bradan Wood](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/northern-ireland/glas-na-bradan-wood/).
As far as I can tell this is an example of afforestation done correctly.

 - Their is a real sense of importance of local engagement, both in the naming of the wood and in the 
   events for tree-planting. "Our vision is for every tree on the site to be planted by the local community".
 - The Woodland Trust's ongoing work to include important environmental policies in the agenda for the
   Northern Irish government including: planting more native tress, restoring all ancient and long-established woodland,
   promoting *locally-sourced* trees over imported ones (very important for biodiversity) and improving 
   access to green spaces. For more details [visit their site](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/northern-ireland/ni-manifesto/).
