 
## Conclusion 

This was a fun, small project I did during COP26. Nothing revolutionary or new, but maybe you learnt something or were inspired by some of the interesting projects highlighted.
If there were any takeaways to be had I think they would be. 

 - Northern Ireland has an amazing amount of diverse, natural habitats that are under serious threat.
 - When it comes to forests (peatland, seagrass etc.) protecting what we've got is paramount and comes before everything else. A large part of that comes down to education and engaging local communities with the natural world. Beyond this, *natural regeneration* seems to be the most long-term, effective way to increase the amount of forest. Tree-planting plays a crucial role, but can go wrong fairly easily.
