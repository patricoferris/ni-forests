## Protecting Forests

Forest management is the study and application of methods aimed 
at increasing or maintaining the health of a collection of trees. Whilst
a [forest might have a well-defined]() meaning, the health of one
is a little fuzzier.

Is health the average volume of trees? At a superficial level a mantra 
of "the more trees the better" sounds good, indeed many so-called
carbon-offsetting companies would have you believe this. But density
alone is not necessarily a good indication of health. We can fit younger
trees more compactly in a given space to augment our density score so
should we chop down all of the old, large trees? Another incredibly important
metric neatly side-stepped here is *biodiversity*. There are [many]() [examples]()
of poorly managed mono-cultures in which many trees of the same species are planted.
Often non-native species with horrendous impact to biodiversity. Sadly,
one of the biggest culprits is none other than [the emerald-isle]() itself!

Is health the economic output of a forest? It is often convenient for 
self-proclaimed environmentalists (like myself) to cry out for more trees,
from the comfort of some [swedish-branded, wooden furniture](). Wood is just one of the 
commodities available from forests and plays an important role in how the forest
is managed. Sustainable consumption. Left unprotected, the [tragedy of the commons]()  
tells us exactly how forests mined for the economic potential well end up.

In truth, there is no well-defined single answer to how healthy a forest is. 
It is a combination of all of these factors (and more) with different priorities 
weighting each depending on which stakeholder group you find yourself in. Turning a blind-eye
to other stakeholders will not lead to any productive, long-term solutions.
