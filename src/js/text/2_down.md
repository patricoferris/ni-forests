## Protecting Forests

Forest management is the study and application of methods aimed 
at increasing or maintaining the health of a collection of trees. The notion of 
a forest is already hard to define (anyone who has read [Colin Tudge's "The Secret Life of Trees"](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-secret-life-of-trees/colin-tudge/9780141012933)
knows how hard it is to even define a tree), the health of a forest is even harder.

A clear distinction is given between *afforestation* (planting trees on land not previously forested)
and *reforestation* (planting trees on land already considered forest). The latter 
does not count as increasing the amount of forest, which could be problematic 
when policies require "more forest". There's a tendency to lean towards afforestation
through monoculture plantations. [J. Ruby Harris-Gavin](https://young-lab.eemb.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/project_muse_776999.pdf) puts it 
bluntly for Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM).

Is health the average volume of trees? At a superficial level a mantra 
of "the more trees the better" sounds good, indeed many so-called
carbon-offsetting companies would have you believe this. But density
alone is not necessarily a good indication of health. We can fit younger
trees more compactly in a given space to augment our density score so
should we chop down all of the old, large trees? Another incredibly important
metric neatly side-stepped here is *biodiversity*. This is evident in the 
monoculture plantations mentioned above. Research has already pointed to the devastating impact this can have,
[Veldman et al.](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/65/10/1011/245863) show
the alarming effect it can have in grassy biomes.

Is health the economic output of a forest? Wood is just one of the 
commodities available from forests and plays an important role in how the forest
is managed. Forests provide a means for regenerative resources to fuel a more sustainable economy.
But left unprotected, the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)
tells us exactly how forests mined for the economic potential well end up. Policy, education and
local community engagement can go a long way in preventing this.

In truth, there is no well-defined single answer to how healthy a forest is. 
It is a combination of all of these factors (and more) with different priorities 
weighting each depending on which stakeholder group you find yourself in. Turning a blind-eye
to other stakeholders will not lead to any productive, long-term solutions. This short section
was somewhat inspired by [John D. Castello](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/castello/)'s and [Stephen A. Teale](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/teale/)'s "Forest Health: An
Integrated Perspective" in which they argue for an objective, scientific method based on mortality rates
and I'll leave you with a quote towards the end of the book:

> The problems facing the world's forests are immense and they will not be solved
> any time soon. However if forest health professionals, scientists and policy makers
> cannot come to a consensus on what a healthy forest is, then there is little hope
> that the processes the reduce and degrade a forests can be objectively assessed...
