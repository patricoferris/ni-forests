## Forests in the sea

When discussing terrestrial carbon sinks most people would think of forests with trees and shrubs. For many people in Ireland (and other parts of the UK such as the Fens in eastern England) another important carbon sink they will be familiar with is peatland. 

[Peatland](https://peatlands.org/peatlands/what-are-peatlands/) is characterised by its
waterlogged ecosystem and is a type of wetland.

 > ... peatlands are carbon rich ecosystems that store and sequester more carbon than any other type of terrestrial ecosystem

Please note, the peatland displayed on the map is both [old data (1980s)](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/priorityhabitats_peatland) and has been simplified with the excellent [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) to help reduce the size of the data to make the map a little more responsive (although you may have to use the keyboard to move about). A more up to date approach might be to use the [Peatland Monitoring from Space](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/68ac541504fc4714b371b1a33e540c95) data.
