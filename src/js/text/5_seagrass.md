## Forests in the sea

For a completely different notion of forest, we can look beneath the waves. Seagrasses are the [only flowering plant able to live in seawater](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/habitats/marine/seagrass#:~:text=Seagrasses%20are%20the%20only%20flowering,terrestrial%20grassland%20%E2%80%93%20an%20underwater%20meadow.&text=It%20has%20been%20calculated%20that,the%20ocean's%20total%20carbon%20absorption.). Seagrass forms *meadows* typically in shallower waters just off the coast. According to [Project Seagrass](https://www.projectseagrass.org/why-seagrass/) and [other sources](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/natural-solutions-climate-change/seagrass):

> Seagrasses occupy 0.1% of the seafloor, yet are responsible for 11% of the organic carbon buried in the ocean.

The data plotted from [OpenDataNI](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/subtidal-and-intertidal-seagrass-beds) shows subtidal and intertidal seagrass beds in [Strangford Lough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangford_Lough) (a Marine Conservation Zone and the British Isles' largest inlet).

During the writing of this section, the [Environment Agency](https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/learn/seagrass-restoration-handbook/) released a handbook for the restoration of seagrass. Strangford Lough gets a special, small mention:

> Patches of seagrass may also occur within pebble and rubble environments (e.g. Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland), near other sensitive sedimentary habitats such as oyster reefs, maerl beds and mussel beds, and within other coastal habitats such as saltmarsh and mudflats.

Unfortunately, [Green et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.629962/full) have brought to light just how catastrophically the seagrass loss in the UK has been. 

> ... at least 44% of United Kingdom's seagrasses have been lost since 1936, 39% since the 1980's. However, losses over longer time spans may be as high as 92%.

The good folk at Project Seagrass are working hard to raise awareness for the disappearing meadows. Recently, they announced [their first Seagrass nursery](https://www.projectseagrass.org/projects/seagrass-nursery-news-vol-1/). The OpenDataNI information seems to suggest more work will be planned to complete mapping in Northern Ireland in particular for Larne Lough and Carlingford Lough.
