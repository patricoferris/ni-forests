## Carbon beneath your feet

When discussing terrestrial carbon sinks most people would think of forests with trees and shrubs. For many people in Ireland (and other parts of the UK such as the Fens in eastern England) another important carbon sink they will be familiar with is peatland. 

[Peatland](https://peatlands.org/peatlands/what-are-peatlands/) is characterised by its waterlogged ecosystem and is a type of wetland. Peat itself (sometimes called turf) is partially decayed vegetation. There are many [types of peatland](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography/research/projects/tropical-peatland/what-are-peatlands) from the temperate, blanket mires here in the UK to the tropical, peat swamps of Southeast Asia. Estimates indicate that [3% of the Earth's surface is made up of peatland](https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/peatlands-and-climate-change).

Incredibly peatlands store and [sequester more carbon than any other type of terrestrial ecosystem](https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/peatlands_and_climate_change_issues_brief_final.pdf).

Please note, the peatland displayed on the map is both [old data (1980s)](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/priorityhabitats_peatland) and has been simplified with the excellent [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) to help reduce the size of the data to make the map a little more responsive (although you may have to use the keyboard to move about). A more up to date approach might be to use the [Peatland Monitoring from Space](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/68ac541504fc4714b371b1a33e540c95) data.

Peatland can provide other important natural processes as well as acting as a carbon sink. In Co. Tyrone peatland restoration is providing cleaner drinking water by acting as a filtration system before water from Lough Bradan reaches the water-treatment facility. This makes the job of treating the water less-intensive using fewer chemicals and less electricity in the process. [BBC NI covered it just recently](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-northern-ireland-59150138).
