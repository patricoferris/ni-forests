## Carbon beneath your feet

When discussing terrestrial carbon sinks most people would think of forests with trees and shrubs. For many people in Ireland (and other parts of the UK such as the Fens in eastern England) another important carbon sink they will be familiar with is peatland. In fact only Canada, Finland and Indonesia have more peatland as a percentage of land cover than the island of Ireland. 

[Peatland](https://peatlands.org/peatlands/what-are-peatlands/) is characterised by its waterlogged ecosystem and is a type of wetland. Peat itself (sometimes called turf) is partially decayed vegetation. There are many [types of peatland](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography/research/projects/tropical-peatland/what-are-peatlands) from the temperate, blanket mires here in the UK to the tropical, peat swamps of Southeast Asia. Estimates indicate that [3% of the Earth's surface is made up of peatland](https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/peatlands-and-climate-change).

Incredibly peatlands store and [sequester more carbon than any other type of terrestrial ecosystem](https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/peatlands_and_climate_change_issues_brief_final.pdf).

Please note, the peatland displayed on the map is both [old data (1980s)](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/priorityhabitats_peatland) and has been simplified with the excellent [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) to help reduce the size of the data to make the map a little more responsive (although you may have to use the keyboard to move about). A more up to date approach might be to use the [Peatland Monitoring from Space](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/68ac541504fc4714b371b1a33e540c95) data. 

Identifying and tracking peatland through satellite imagery is challenging but a worthwhile pursuit. As [Prof. Kevin Tansey](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography/people/kjt7) for [the MDPI special issue on the "Remote Sensing of Peatlands" put it](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing/special_issues/peatland):

> ... Satellite data can be used to establish the extent of peatlands, their elevation and topographic characteristics, the land use/land cover change history, the diversity of the vegetation, the fire disturbance impacts and various measurements associated with the atmosphere, such as emissions, smoke and air quality.

There are some interesting papers in that special issue, in particular [Rahman et al.'s "A New Method to Map Groundwater Table in Peatlands Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles"](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/10/1057) is very cool! The author's describe a technique of interpolating known groundwater level (GWL) measurements to estimate the GWL across the peatland. The known measurements are from areas of surface water which are captured using a UAV. They used [ENVI](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/ENVI) to extract the open water sections from the images.

Peatland can provide other important natural processes as well as acting as a carbon sink. In Co. Tyrone peatland restoration is providing cleaner drinking water by acting as a filtration system before water from Lough Bradan reaches the water treatment facility. This makes the job of treating the water less intensive using fewer chemicals and less electricity in the process. [BBC NI covered it just recently](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-northern-ireland-59150138).

Northern Ireland does have a peatland restoration and protection plan, their [consultation document is available online](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/consultations/daera/Northern%20Ireland%20Peatland%20Strategy%202021-2040.%20Consultation%20Document.pdf). They note some of the worrying trends that put our peatland at serious threat:

> ...  Since the early 1980s there has been a trend towards mechanised peat extraction, which has greatly accelerated bog degradation and loss... On bogs, inappropriate levels of grazing and trampling from grazing livestock can have adverse effects on the peatland ecosystem...

But the amount of protection seems woefully low

> The best areas of semi-natural peatland habitats in Northern Ireland are designated and protected under National, European and International nature conservation legislation to afford them the greatest protection. However, site designation only covers around 10% of seminatural peatland habitat in Northern Ireland.

Their objectives and strategies are heading in the right direction, but given the emergency of the climate crisis are worded a little vaguely and cautiously (but perhaps that's just politics). 

> 21. Encourage the reduction and cessation of the use of peat by all statutory bodies and agencies by end of 2022.
> 22. Seek to phase out the use, import and sale of peat compost in Northern Ireland by 2025.
> 23. Conduct a review on the potential for a ban on peat extraction on all publicly owned land by 2022.

Whilst writing this section, the [National Trust joined others in calling for a ban on peat products](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59195535). Peat is commonly used as compost and in particular for the new trees used in reforestation efforts. This is a good step in the right direction, but the slowness of the response is worrying.
