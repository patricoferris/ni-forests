<h2>Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>This is Northern Ireland. One of the four <em>countries</em> that make
up the United Kingdom. Here are some things you might not have
known:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of the <a href="https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2011-census-key-statistics-northern-ireland">2011 census</a>
it has a population of 1,811,000 people.
</li>
<li>Lough Neagh is the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lough-Neagh">largest lake</a> in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/British-Isles">British Isles</a>. I'll let you work out where that is on the map.
</li>
<li>It has the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12322222">most bombed hotel in Europe</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, this interactive app was made during <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26</a> whilst I was living in Cambridge feeling utterly useless. The idea was to discover more about the forests in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p><em>For the programmers out there, it is all made using <a href="https://v3.ocaml.org">OCaml</a> and is <a href="https://github.com/patricoferris/ni-forests">open-source</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Forests and Woodland Cover by County</h2>
<p>Northern Ireland is made up of six counties. The map now shows
the woodland and forest cover per county.</p>
<p>The colours indicate the percentage of woodland cover when compared to
total land per county. Totals are also given. The unit of measurement
here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare">hectare</a>, for those
unfamiliar it is a unit of measurement for area and is equivalent to
10,000 square metres (<code>100m x 100m</code>).</p>
<p>Taken at face value, Fermanagh is quite clearly ahead of the other counties
in terms of percentage woodland cover (~15.9%) and Armagh the worst (~5.5%).</p>
<p>Taking these numbers and averaging them out yields <strong>8.9%</strong> forest cover. The EU
<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/105/the-european-union-and-forests#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20forests%20cover%2037.7,10">quotes around <em>37.7%</em></a>
of its land area being forest. Not necessarily a fair comparison given factors like
population density, feasible economic activity (e.g. farming) and habitability. But even
compared to a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/07/20/why-frances-forests-are-getting-bigger">close neighbour like France (~31%)</a>
it is really not great.</p>
<p>Another often overlooked dimension to &quot;forest cover&quot; is the type of forest. <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/habitats/ancient-woodland/">Ancient woodland</a>
(areas wooded since before 1600) is one of the most valuable habitats in the UK. The <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/">Woodland Trust</a>
<a href="https://ati.woodlandtrust.org.uk/back-on-the-map">conducted a survey</a> aiming to identifiy <em>long-established</em> (~1830) woods in Northern Ireland. They found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woods that could be classified with any degree of certainty as ancient were many times scarcer in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK, covering only 0.04 per cent of Northern Ireland's land area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A truly sad statistic.</p>
<h2>Protecting Forests</h2>
<p>Forest management is the study and application of methods aimed
at increasing or maintaining the health of a collection of trees. The notion of
a forest is already hard to define (anyone who has read <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-secret-life-of-trees/colin-tudge/9780141012933">Colin Tudge's &quot;The Secret Life of Trees&quot;</a>
knows how hard it is to even define a tree), the health of a forest is even harder.</p>
<p>A clear distinction is given between <em>afforestation</em> (planting trees on land not previously forested)
and <em>reforestation</em> (planting trees on land already considered forest). The latter
does not count as increasing the amount of forest, which could be problematic
when policies require &quot;more forest&quot;. There's a tendency to lean towards afforestation
through monoculture plantations. <a href="https://young-lab.eemb.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/project_muse_776999.pdf">J. Ruby Harris-Gavin</a> puts it
bluntly for Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... DAFM are technically creating new forests
based on their own respective definitions, they are actually cultivating
monoculture tree plantations of single species - moreover, they are
doing so in areas with trees planted too close together for any wildlife
or other plant life to survive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is health the average volume of trees? At a superficial level a mantra
of &quot;the more trees the better&quot; sounds good, indeed many so-called
carbon-offsetting companies would have you believe this. But density
alone is not necessarily a good indication of health. We can fit younger
trees more compactly in a given space to augment our density score so
should we chop down all of the old, large trees? Another incredibly important
metric neatly side-stepped here is <em>biodiversity</em>. This is evident in the
monoculture plantations mentioned above. Research has already pointed to the devastating impact this can have,
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/65/10/1011/245863">Veldman et al.</a> show
the alarming effect it can have in grassy biomes.</p>
<p>Is health the economic output of a forest? Wood is just one of the
commodities available from forests and plays an important role in how the forest
is managed. Forests provide a means for regenerative resources to fuel a more sustainable economy.
But left unprotected, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>
tells us exactly how forests mined for the economic potential well end up. Policy, education and
local community engagement can go a long way in preventing this.</p>
<p>In truth, there is no well-defined single answer to how healthy a forest is.
It is a combination of all of these factors (and more) with different priorities
weighting each depending on which stakeholder group you find yourself in. Turning a blind-eye
to other stakeholders will not lead to any productive, long-term solutions. This short section
was somewhat inspired by <a href="https://www.esf.edu/faculty/castello/">John D. Castello</a>'s and <a href="https://www.esf.edu/faculty/teale/">Stephen A. Teale</a>'s &quot;Forest Health: An
Integrated Perspective&quot; in which they argue for an objective, scientific method based on mortality rates
and I'll leave you with a quote towards the end of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problems facing the world's forests are immense and they will not be solved
any time soon. However if forest health professionals, scientists and policy makers
cannot come to a consensus on what a healthy forest is, then there is little hope
that the processes the reduce and degrade a forests can be objectively assessed...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>New Trees in the Belfast Hills</h2>
<p>After protecting existing trees and <a href="https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/explore-rewilding/what-is-rewilding">rewilding</a>
as much as possible through <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/natural-regeneration/">natural regeneration</a>, there's
still a need to plant trees.</p>
<p>Not only that, but we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To plant the right kind of trees. More specifically, native trees. Even better are locally-sourced,
native trees which provide some of the same benefits of natural regeneration in that we minimise
potential for bio-security risk (from pests and invasive species) and aim to keep genetic diversity and
adaption to specific local environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage local communities. To reach the scale necessary for success engagement in local communities is
paramount. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15498">Sacco and Hardwick et al.</a> state it
very well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For large-scale reforestation projects, engagement of multiple stakeholders is required, to meet
the diverse goals of enhancing rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration,
watershed protection and the provision of other ecosystem services</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact their paper is well worth a read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incentive to keep the newly planted trees alive whilst simultaneously ensuring
the system is trusted. We've already seen the exploitation of &quot;tree planting&quot; for
economic profit or a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies">nice badge for large corporations to flash</a>
around claiming they are &quot;socially responsible&quot;. See <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/4c">The Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits</a>
for some interesting work to establish trusted infrastructure for tackling this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The map has zoomed in to near Cavehill and Belfast Zoo where the Woodland Trust are planning on planting some 150,000 trees
for a new <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/northern-ireland/glas-na-bradan-wood/">Glas-na-Bradan Wood</a>.
As far as I can tell this is an example of afforestation done correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a real sense of importance of local engagement, both in the naming of the wood and in the
events for tree-planting. &quot;Our vision is for every tree on the site to be planted by the local community&quot;.
In fact I dispatched my parents to plant some of them.
</li>
<li>The Woodland Trust's ongoing work to include important environmental policies in the agenda for the
Northern Irish government including: planting more native tress, restoring all ancient and long-established woodland,
promoting <em>locally-sourced</em> trees over imported ones and improving access to green spaces. For more details <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/northern-ireland/ni-manifesto/">visit their site</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Access to green space is incredibly important. The <a href="https://nhsforest.org/">NHS Forest</a> project is evidence of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NHS Forest works with healthcare professionals and organisations to make green spaces available for health purposes. We carry out practical work on the empirical links between health and the environment.</p>

<h2>Carbon beneath your feet</h2>
<p>When discussing terrestrial carbon sinks most people would think of forests with trees and shrubs. For many people in Ireland (and other parts of the UK such as the Fens in eastern England) another important carbon sink they will be familiar with is peatland.</p>
<p><a href="https://peatlands.org/peatlands/what-are-peatlands/">Peatland</a> is characterised by its waterlogged ecosystem and is a type of wetland. Peat itself (sometimes called turf) is partially decayed vegetation. There are many <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography/research/projects/tropical-peatland/what-are-peatlands">types of peatland</a> from the temperate, blanket mires here in the UK to the tropical, peat swamps of Southeast Asia. Estimates indicate that <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/peatlands-and-climate-change">3% of the Earth's surface is made up of peatland</a>.</p>
<p>Incredibly peatlands store and <a href="https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/peatlands_and_climate_change_issues_brief_final.pdf">sequester more carbon than any other type of terrestrial ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>Please note, the peatland displayed on the map is both <a href="https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/priorityhabitats_peatland">old data (1980s)</a> and has been simplified with the excellent <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">mapshaper</a> to help reduce the size of the data to make the map a little more responsive (although you may have to use the keyboard to move about). A more up to date approach might be to use the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/68ac541504fc4714b371b1a33e540c95">Peatland Monitoring from Space</a> data.</p>
<p>Peatland can provide other important natural processes as well as acting as a carbon sink. In Co. Tyrone peatland restoration is providing cleaner drinking water by acting as a filtration system before water from Lough Bradan reaches the water-treatment facility. This makes the job of treating the water less-intensive using fewer chemicals and less electricity in the process. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-northern-ireland-59150138">BBC NI covered it just recently</a>.</p>
<h2>Forests in the sea</h2>
